# BANKING-SYSTEM
  This is a simple Java-based Banking Management System designed to manage user accounts and perform basic banking operations. 
    The project uses OOP concepts, supports multiple account types, and stores all data locally for future use.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED
  Java SE – Core programming language

  Swing (JFrame, JList, JButton, etc.) – For building the GUI

  Collections (DefaultListModel) – For storing and displaying account lists

  File I/O – For saving and loading account data

  Object-Oriented Programming – Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction

  Command Line (javac & java) – For compilation and execution

# ENVIRONMENT SETUP
   Install Java JDK 8 or above
   
   Download or clone the project

  Ensure the folder structure is correct inside src :

          /bank
          /gui
          /Data
          /Exceptions
          Main.java

# NOTES 
    * The application uses Java Swing for all user interface screens.
   
    * All account operations (add, deposit, withdraw, display) work only after successful login.
   
    * The project follows OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
   
    * Only valid account types (Savings, Current, Student) can be created through the GUI.
   
    * Make sure all .java files are compiled before running the application from the command line.
